# Web Application for Image and Raster Interaction

Build a simple web application using React that displays a static image with an overlaid raster grid. The application should enable users to interact with individual cells in the raster grid via a vertical list view, toggling their visibility on the image.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

To install the dependencies.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
